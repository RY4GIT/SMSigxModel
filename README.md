#### Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) Model
The CFE model is designed to be a simplified and functionaly equivalent model of the National Water Model. The model code was originally written by Dr. Fred Ogden and converted to BMI-compliant format in the Next-Gen framework by NOAA-OWP. The official CFE code by Dr. Fred Oden and NOAA-OWP lives [here](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cfe/).  [The Python version of the code](https://github.com/NWC-CUAHSI-Summer-Institute/cfe_py) is developed for the prototyping, research, and development. This code is developed upon the Python version and for research purpose. 

## Installation
